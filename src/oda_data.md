# ODA Data
ODA data gets updated twice a year. In April, we get the big pictureâ€”total ODA by donor countries for the previous year. By December, the details roll in: where the money went, broken down by recipient country, sector, region, and income group. Plus, partial updates in June and September.

The OECD publishes ODA data across numerous tables, which makes it tricky to find the information you need. 

To simplify things, ONE's main sources of ODA data include:

- [DAC1](oda_data/dac1): Provides a broad overview of aid distribution from the donor's perspective.
- [DAC2A](oda_data/dac2a): Useful for tracking flows of ODA from a donor to a recipient.
- [CRS](oda_data/crs): Contains detailed, project-level data, making it useful for tracking specific aid activities.
- [Multisystem](oda_data/multisystem): Combines data from multiple sources to provide a comprehensive view of both bilateral and multilateral aid flows.
