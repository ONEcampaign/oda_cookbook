# ODA Data
ODA data gets updated twice a year. In April, we get the big pictureâ€”total ODA by donor countries for the previous year. By December, the details roll in: where the money went, broken down by recipient country, sector, region, and income group. Plus, partial updates in June and September.

The OECD publishes ODA data across numerous tables, which makes it tricky to find the information you need. 

At ONE, we get most of our ODA data from:

- [DAC1](./oda-data/dac1): Provides a broad overview of aid distribution from the donor's perspective.
- [DAC2A](./oda-data/dac2a): Useful for tracking flows of ODA from a donor to a recipient.
- [CRS](./oda-data/crs): Provides detailed project-level data, making it useful to identify the sectors receiving aid.
- [MultiSystem](./oda-data/multisystem): Uses CRS data to provide information on multilateral aid.
